# Meeting & Interview Agenda Implementation Documentation

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ✅ 1. Database Schema Updates - COMPLETED

**Fixed Meeting Model Issues:**
- ✅ Added `jobId` field - the meeting table now tracks which job the resume/meeting relates to
- ✅ Added proper relationship tracking for: Job → Resume → Meeting
- ✅ Added interview type categorization with `InterviewType` enum
- ✅ Made `resumeId` unique for 1:1 relationship (one meeting per resume)
- ✅ Database migration completed successfully

**Updated Schema:**
```prisma
model Meeting {
  id             String         @id @default(cuid())
  meetingTime    DateTime
  meetingLink    String?
  meetingSummary String?
  meetingRating  String?
  meetingType    MeetingType?
  agenda         String?        // Generated agenda from AI
  status         MeetingStatus  @default(SCHEDULED)
  notes          String?        // Manual notes field for PUT method
  interviewType  InterviewType? // New field for interview difficulty
  jobId          String         // Required field linking to job
  resumeId       String         @unique // 1:1 relationship - one meeting per resume
  createdAt      DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime       @updatedAt
  createdById    Int
  
  // Relations
  createdBy      User           @relation(fields: [createdById], references: [id])
  resume         Resume         @relation(fields: [resumeId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  job            JobPost        @relation(fields: [jobId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

// Added new enum for interview types
enum InterviewType {
  TECHNICAL
  BEHAVIORAL
  EASY
  COMPLEX
  MEDIUM
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### External API Integration Pattern
Following existing `generate-job-description.ts` pattern:
```typescript
// 1. ✅ Validate request parameters

// 3. ✅ Call external API with proper error handling
// 4. ✅ Transform response back to internal format
// 5. ✅ Return structured response
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- ✅ API Timeout: 30 second timeout for external calls
- ✅ Network Errors: Graceful fallback with retry options
- ✅ Invalid Data: Validate resume data before API call
- ✅ Missing Fields: Show user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Rate Limiting: Handle external API rate limits

### Security Implementation
- ✅ Authentication: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- ✅ Authorization: Users can only access their company's data
- ✅ Input Validation: Sanitize all user inputs
- ✅ External API: Secure external API calls
- ✅ Data Privacy: Handle candidate data according to privacy requirements
