# S3 Presigned URL Migration Status

## Current Status: ⏳ WAITING FOR DATABASE ACCESS

The database server at `153.92.223.64:5432` is currently not accessible. All migration files and scripts are ready to execute when the database becomes available.

## Migration Files Created

### ✅ Database Schema

- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated with `s3Key` field
- **Manual SQL**: `manual-migration.sql` - Fallback SQL migration
- **Status**: Ready to run when database is accessible

### ✅ Data Migration

- **Script**: `scripts/migrate-resume-urls.js` - Extracts S3 keys from existing URLs
- **Status**: Ready to run after schema migration

### ✅ Testing & Verification

- **Test Script**: `scripts/test-migration.js` - Verifies migration success
- **Database Check**: `scripts/check-database.js` - Monitors database availability
- **Status**: Ready to run after migration

### ✅ Application Updates

- **API Endpoint**: `src/pages/api/resumes/[resumeId]/presigned-url.ts` - Fresh URL generation
- **Frontend**: Updated CV access in all components
- **S3 Service**: Modified to store S3 keys instead of presigned URLs
- **Status**: Code changes complete and ready

## Quick Migration Commands

When the database becomes accessible, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Check database connectivity
node scripts/check-database.js

# 2. Run schema migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_s3_key_to_resume

# 3. Run data migration
node scripts/migrate-resume-urls.js

# 4. Test migration
node scripts/test-migration.js

# 5. Start application and test
npm run dev
```

## What the Migration Will Do

### Schema Changes:

- Add `s3Key` column to `Resume` table
- Create index on `s3Key` for performance
- Preserve all existing data

### Data Migration:

- Extract S3 keys from existing presigned URLs
- Update `s3Key` field for resumes with presigned URLs
- Skip resumes that don't have presigned URLs
- Provide detailed migration report

### Application Benefits:

- CV links will work without expiration errors
- Fresh presigned URLs generated on-demand (1-hour expiry)
- Backward compatibility for old resumes
- Better security with shorter URL expiry

## Monitoring Database Availability

Run this command periodically to check when the database becomes available:

```bash
node scripts/check-database.js
```

When you see "✅ Database is ready for migration!", you can proceed with the migration steps.

## Expected Results After Migration

### Before Migration:

- CV links fail with "AccessDenied" after 24 hours
- Presigned URLs stored in database expire
- Users cannot access old CVs

### After Migration:

- CV links work reliably without expiration
- Fresh presigned URLs generated on-demand
- Old resumes work with fallback to original URLs
- New uploads store S3 keys for fresh URL generation

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

- `src/pages/api/resumes/[resumeId]/presigned-url.ts`
- `src/lib/resume-url-service.ts`
- `scripts/migrate-resume-urls.js`
- `scripts/test-migration.js`
- `scripts/check-database.js`
- `manual-migration.sql`
- `S3_PRESIGNED_URL_FIX.md`
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`

### Modified Files:

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added s3Key field
- `src/lib/s3-service.ts` - Return S3 keys instead of presigned URLs
- `src/pages/api/jobs/[jobId]/upload-and-analyze.ts` - Store S3 keys
- `src/pages/cv-sorting/[jobId].tsx` - Updated CV access
- `src/components/assessment/JobResumeManager.tsx` - Updated CV access

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor database availability** using `node scripts/check-database.js`
2. **Run migration** when database is accessible
3. **Test thoroughly** to ensure CV access works
4. **Deploy to production** with confidence

The migration is fully prepared and ready to execute as soon as the database becomes available.
